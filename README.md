# REToolbox
An addon for Ascension Classless realms. Allows you to see if characters on your account or your guildies have a particular Mystic Enchant in their collection.

ZIP files found in [Latest Releases](https://github.com/Nihilianth/REToolbox/releases/tag/v0.0.2b) already contain the required libraries . If you already have DataStore r26, you don't have to replace it.

## New in Version 0.0.2b: Item tooltips
You can now see RE information while browsing Auction House items and viewing bags / item links.

### Addon description
Based around [DataStore r26](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/datastore/files/437591) aswell as the custom module [DataStore_AscensionRE](https://github.com/Nihilianth/DataStore_AscensionRE)


After installing this addon the RE tooltips will reflect if your alts or your guildies (using this addon) have this certain RE in their collection.

This addon will provide you a link to the new RE after adding it to your collection. You are also be able to check if your current character has an enchant before attempting to extract it.
